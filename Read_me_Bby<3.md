## 👋 Hi, I’m David Useche Rosas
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about backend and frontend development using coding languages, such as Python, CSS/html/Javascript/Java and more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java which is really interesting and make me feel apassionate about the design and development of websites or whatever related to this. I'm eager to learn in the future other programming languages like JavaScript and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any companie or current proyect, just get in touch with me and I'll be willing to help you and to learn in the process :)
- 📫 How to reach me: well, I let you here my email: daviduseche09@gmail.com <3
- Oh, I speak two languages both english and spanish, and currently learning french, so... if you wanted to know hehehe.
